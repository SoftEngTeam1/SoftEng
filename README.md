## Overal Description

  - A platform that combines the users financial platforms. This will make it easier for the user to understand and track their finances. Specically in the crypto currency realm many of the new platforms do not have easy to read graphical and table visuals to track your investments. Our product will combine investment profolios into one account with graphical insight, an optional trading bot for the user to use, news sources and user choice for media coverage, security of login, possible copy trading, and much more. 

  - For instance if a user has 30% of their porfolio in Fidelity, 20% in Robinhood, 20% in Coinbase Pro, and 30% in TD Amitrade, this website would allow the user to only need to sign into this account to get an analysis of all of their finances at the same time.

## GOALS

   - Implement bots
   - Visualize different ranges of history (6mo, 1 yr, etc.)
   - Have a bot watch market shorts (?)
   - Focus on stocks alone vs focus on crypto
   - Combining stocks with crypto is a specialty that there is not a great solution for so far â†’ great niche audience and market
   - No centralized visual feedback on crypto stocks
   - Could use inspiration from Robinhood API
   - Implement crypto stock recommendations
   - Based on stocks invested
   - News spotlight focus based on analyst personalizations
